                        with children in Ukraine who need humanitarian assistance inside Ukraine as a result of the war.
                    </li>
                    <li>UNICEF encourage all families with children who consider themselves in need to apply for
                        assistance through this service.

                    <li>Participating in this survey does not mean that you are entitled to assistance. UNICEF and
                        humanitarian partners will analyze the data for possible eligibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>UNICEF will prioritize large families (three children and more) with at least one child between
                        0 and 2 years of age and provide cash transfer via bank account.
